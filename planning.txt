Ok, so tf am I doing here.

This first pass impl will need to create the maps that provide variable context
of functions. This will be used in the semantic analysis phase so we can determine
at compile time whether a referenced variable is actually valid or not.

What does the first pass need to return?

Given the name of the symbol, I want to get as a key:
( functionHeader, functionSymbolMap).
So, when we parse a function declaration, we'll create the functionSymbolMap
of all declared variables inside the function (and what line).

Ok, well I think it'd be wise to keep the first declaration sweep as simple
as possible. So, only gather the header declaration for the symbol lookup.

So, our existing code can look at the function header, and determine that 
we're even able to assign the function to the variable.

so
- write function that does sweep of reading all function declarations and 
creating a map for all of them. Map<String, FunctionHeader>. This map will
be specifically used for type checking, and nothing else.

Here's the function declaration syntax.
function name (String arg1, Number arg2, etc... ) returns Number
function name (String arg1, Number arg2, etc... ) returns String
function name (String arg1, Number arg2, etc... ) returns Void
(void return type must always be typed, it is not implied)
